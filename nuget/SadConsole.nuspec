    <description>A MonoGame library that emulates old-school console and command prompt style graphics. Use the SadConsole.Starter package for new projects.</description>
    <releaseNotes>
      - Added new Palette and Timer classes.
      - Added extension method to ColorGradient that returns a Color[] based on the stops.
      - Fixed a bug in InputBox that happened when you clicked twice on the control. Thanks arxae and naknode!
      - Fixed effect manager remove methods.
      - Fixed mouse processing other consoles after it was found over the top-most
      - Created a LayeredSurface.Load single param overload to block accidentally calling BasicSurface.Load
      - MouseHandler for a Console has changed. If it assigned, the normal mouse processing logic will no longer run.
      - Fixed rendering problem with consoles created after initialization. (thanks kingvitamin103)
      ## 6.4.5
      - Added SadConsole.GameHelpers.Directions class and helpers.
      - SurfaceEditor now supports basic shape functions. Easier to draw shapes than previous model. (Line only supported for now, more to come)
      - Lines can be auto connected through static SurfaceEditor.ConnectLines method.
      - Promoted a bunch of private members for the Window class to protected.
      - Window title row can be positioned by the class now. Use the protected titleLocationY variable.
      - ListBox.HideBorder instantly redraws instead of waiting for a `IsDirty` flag.
      ## 6.4.6
      - Fixed logic for TabStop with ControlsConsole. It was stopping a focused control from being tabbed off of, not stopping a control from being tabbed to.
      - Keyboard input was reversing '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'
      - Controls now refresh when you change the theme with Control.Theme = variable.
      ## 6.4.7
      - Fixed keyboard problem with selection button.
      - Font class now has a link back to the FontMaster instance.
      - Added SadConsole.Settings.GraphicsProfile for monogame hidef vs reach.
      - Added a Mouse.Clear to clear state (like keyboard has)
      - Game has a OnDestroy callback now for when the game starts to shut down.
      - VirtualCursor bugs fixed. Also supports print effects again.
      - DrawString instruction uses a VirtualCursor all the time (.Cursor property) to fix issues with printing. (thanks vga256)
      - VirtualCursor uses the solid square character as default now instead of underscore.
      - FontMaster caches Font objects created with GetFont. The same instance is passed around now instead of a new one.
      - Fade effect has UseCellDestinationReverse to reverse the logic of the of using the back/fore cell color.
      ## 6.4.8
      - Added Settings.WindowMinimumSize.
