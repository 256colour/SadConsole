SadConsole
==========

SadConsole is an MonoGame 3.2 and XNA 4.0 based game library that provides an engine to emulate old-school console and command prompt style graphics. One or more textures are used to represent the standard ascii character set. SadConsole allows you to create console instances which can be managed independently of each other. A console is made up of individual cells which can have a foreground, background, character, and a special effect applied to it. 

Right now, SadConsole only targets the Windows platform using MonoGame and XNA 4.0. Eventually, the engine will be compiled for all of the platforms that MonoGame supports.
